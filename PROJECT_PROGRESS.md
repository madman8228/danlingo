## 2026-04-15 - Hide relation candidate panel when no pending items
- Current status:
  - Updated [LexicalAssetImportPanel.tsx](/d:/06-project/expo_duo/duoxx/components/admin/LexicalAssetImportPanel.tsx) to show `Relation Candidate Review` only when there are pending candidates.
  - When `pendingReview=0` and candidate list is empty, the panel is not rendered on page load/refresh.
- Verification:
  - `duoxx`: `npx tsc --noEmit` passed.
  - `duoxx`: `npm run lint -- components/admin/LexicalAssetImportPanel.tsx` passed.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - None for this behavior change.
- Next concrete work item:
  - If needed, add an explicit "Show Batch Details" toggle for low-frequency diagnostics instead of auto-display.

## 2026-04-15 - Import panel template actions moved to secondary tier
- Current status:
  - Updated [LexicalAssetImportPanel.tsx](/d:/06-project/expo_duo/duoxx/components/admin/LexicalAssetImportPanel.tsx) to demote template actions from the primary action row.
  - Primary row now only keeps core workflow actions (choose file / create batch / publish / clear).
  - Template downloads are now in a secondary utility row (`Templates (Optional)`) with lighter link-style affordance.
- Verification:
  - `duoxx`: `npx tsc --noEmit` passed.
  - `duoxx`: `npm run lint -- components/admin/LexicalAssetImportPanel.tsx src/storage/lexicalAssetImportSessionStorage.ts` passed.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - No functional behavior changes to import pipeline; this is hierarchy/interaction emphasis only.
- Next concrete work item:
  - If needed, add a collapsible "More tools" wrapper so optional utilities can be hidden by default.

## 2026-04-15 - Import panel stale warning/session persistence fix
- Current status:
  - Updated import session storage version to `v2` in [lexicalAssetImportSessionStorage.ts](/d:/06-project/expo_duo/duoxx/src/storage/lexicalAssetImportSessionStorage.ts) to drop stale cached parse state.
  - Added `batchId` into persisted import session so refresh can restore current batch context.
  - Updated [LexicalAssetImportPanel.tsx](/d:/06-project/expo_duo/duoxx/components/admin/LexicalAssetImportPanel.tsx):
    - restore `batchId` on hydration and auto-refresh batch report/candidates,
    - after successful import batch creation, clear in-memory parser review/file fields so old parse warnings are not repeatedly shown,
    - persist `review: null` once `batchId` exists to keep UI focused on batch review.
- Verification:
  - `duoxx`: `npx tsc --noEmit` passed.
  - `duoxx`: `npm run lint -- components/admin/LexicalAssetImportPanel.tsx src/storage/lexicalAssetImportSessionStorage.ts` passed.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - Import flow is still manual for save/publish actions.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Add optional one-click "upload -> create batch -> refresh review" action (still stop before publish).

## 2026-04-15 - Remove 1A local asset-build path
- Current status:
  - Removed 1A local-processing feature artifacts from repo:
    - deleted `scripts/build-knowledge-dag-assets.js`
    - deleted `.codex/skills/knowledge-dag-asset-builder/`
    - deleted generated output folder `asserts/knowledge-dag/`
  - Active workflow is now simplified to direct admin upload/import/review/publish in `/admin/pipeline -> Review Hub -> Import`.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - None for this removal.
- Next concrete work item:
  - If needed, add in-page one-click auto-run (upload -> create batch -> refresh report) without reintroducing local file-build step.

## 2026-04-15 - Lexical markdown parser plural-header fix
- Current status:
  - Fixed parser routing for structured markdown assets in [lexicalSingleFileImport.ts](/d:/06-project/expo_duo/duoxx/src/services/lexicalSingleFileImport.ts:1178).
  - Structured detector now accepts plural and explicit headers used by uploaded files:
    - `collocations`, `phrases`, `sentencePatterns`, `idioms`, `spokenExpressions` (plus singular forms).
  - This prevents files from falling back to word-parser mode that generates mass `ORPHAN_FIELD` warnings (`Field appears outside a word block`).
- Verification:
  - `duoxx`: `npx tsc --noEmit` passed.
  - `duoxx`: `npm test -- src/services/__tests__/assetParseDiagnostics.test.ts --runInBand` passed.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - Import tab still requires manual `Save Assets` and `Publish`.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Add one-click import flow that automatically creates batch and refreshes report/candidates after upload.

## 2026-04-14 - Knowledge absorb breadcrumb depth rule finalized
- Current status:
  - Breadcrumb display now uses explicit rule `navigationStack.length >= 2`.
  - Depth `1`: no breadcrumb chip shown.
  - Depth `2+`: first level and current level are both shown.
  - Card title top spacing follows the same rule (only offsets when breadcrumb is visible).
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - None for this behavior.
- Next concrete work item:
  - If needed, add a small interaction test around breadcrumb depth transitions to prevent future regressions.

## 2026-04-14 - Knowledge absorb breadcrumb visibility rule (hide single-item breadcrumb)
- Current status:
  - `duoxx/app/knowledge-absorb.tsx` now shows breadcrumb row only when `navigationStack.length > 1`.
  - Single-node state no longer shows the redundant first breadcrumb chip above the card title.
  - Title offset for breadcrumb mode now follows the same condition, removing wasted top spacing in single-node state.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - None for this behavior change.
- Next concrete work item:
  - If you want, add a tiny enter animation only when breadcrumb appears (2+ levels) so hierarchy transition is clearer.

## 2026-04-14 - Knowledge absorb expansion items support click-to-drill
- Current status:
  - In `duoxx/app/knowledge-absorb.tsx`, expansion knowledge rows are now clickable.
  - Clicking an expansion item now opens that node as the active top card via existing `handleOpenNode` flow.
  - Breadcrumb path and node-specific expansion loading continue to work on the clicked target.
  - Expansion rows now include right chevron affordance and improved tappable row layout.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - No additional interaction animation/polish was added in this step (only behavior + baseline visual affordance).
- Next concrete work item:
  - If UX needs stronger feedback, add pressed-state visuals and small motion to expansion row taps.

## 2026-04-10 - Pipeline graph node search missing go/get (active scope fallback fix)
- Current status:
  - Backend `listNodes` now supports keyword fallback:
    - if `scope=active` + keyword has no active hits, it auto-searches the active published snapshot and returns matching rows.
  - Response meta now includes `fallbackScope`, `fallbackReason`, and `snapshotVersion` for visibility.
  - Admin panel now shows hint text when displayed rows are from snapshot fallback.
  - Added integration test coverage for this behavior in `src/services/__tests__/lexiconGraphService.integration.test.js`.
  - Frontend type definitions updated to include new fallback meta fields.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - Backend jest execution is blocked in this Windows workspace because backend dev dependencies are unavailable (`cross-env` missing in current shell environment).
- Next concrete work item:
  - Re-run backend test in the server environment with dependencies installed:
    - `npm test -- src/services/__tests__/lexiconGraphService.integration.test.js --runInBand`
  - Manually verify in `/admin/pipeline` that searching `go` / `get` under active scope now returns results (with fallback hint visible when triggered).

## 2026-04-10 - Admin pipeline graph relations UI polish (knowledge graph view)
- Current status:
  - `duoxx/components/admin/LexiconGraphExplorerPanel.tsx` relation-group tabs are now compact horizontal chips with separate count badges.
  - Fixed the stretched vertical-pill issue in the relation-group strip by constraining tab height and cross-axis alignment.
  - Relation rows now show clearer metadata pills (`relation type`, `confidence`) and improved spacing/background for faster scan.
  - Added edge-type label mapping for user-facing readability (`formatEdgeTypeLabel`).
  - Type check passed: `npx tsc --noEmit` (in `duoxx/`).
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - Browser visual QA against real admin runtime has not yet been re-run in this task.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Run `/admin/pipeline` manual visual smoke on desktop + narrower viewport and adjust chip truncation rules only if long labels overflow.

## 2026-04-03 - Admin /pipeline Review Hub browser smoke after MCP recovery
- Current status:
  - Browser automation channel recovered and used for real UI validation on `http://localhost:8081/admin/pipeline`.
  - Login with operator account succeeded and dashboard rendered normally.
  - Clicking `Review Hub` did not reproduce the prior runtime crash (`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')`).
  - Console showed only normal login/course-fetch logs, no error/warn stack for Review Hub.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - This round is smoke-level validation; no exhaustive dataset permutation test was run.
- Next concrete work item:
  - If user can still reproduce intermittently, capture the exact click sequence + imported dataset id and run focused reproduction with the same data.
## 2026-04-03 - Browser MCP transport recovery (playwright + chrome_devtools)
- Current status:
  - Browser automation transport recovered in-session: both `mcp__playwright__browser_tabs` and `mcp__chrome_devtools__list_pages` now return normal results.
  - The prior error was `Transport closed` on both channels, indicating MCP connection-layer failure rather than page logic failure.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - Root-cause certainty is inferred from process behavior; there is no dedicated per-session MCP crash trace exposed in current logs.
- Next concrete work item:
  - If this recurs, immediately capture the Codex app-server process list + MCP call error timestamp, then do the same minimal app-server recycle flow.
## 2026-04-03 - Graph-first runtime smoke (manual trigger, no scheduler)
- Current status:
  - Live API smoke on http://localhost:3000 passed with real login (/api/auth/login) and operator token.
  - Retired routes now behave as expected: /api/pipeline/quizzes* and /api/learning/lexical-quizzes/active return 404.
  - Graph-first learner route works: /api/learning/recommendations returns recommendations and snapshot version.
  - Import -> report -> publish -> recommendation loop was executed once successfully via:
    - POST /api/pipeline/lexicon/import-batches
    - GET /api/pipeline/lexicon/import-batches/:batchId/report
    - POST /api/pipeline/lexicon/publish
  - Strict quality gate consistency was fixed in service code: report/publish now share the same gate evaluator.
  - Added integration regression assertion to guarantee report qualityReport.passed aligns with publish behavior.
  - Restarted WSL backend runtime and re-ran live smoke: report_passed=True and publish succeeded consistently for the same batch.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - Frontend browser-level click path (/admin/pipeline full UI interactions) has not been re-run in this round.
  - Automated browser MCP channels were unavailable in this session (transport closed), so Review Hub click flow still needs manual/browser verification.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Run one browser-level admin smoke on /admin/pipeline (Import & Review + Review Hub click path) against this restarted runtime.
## 2026-03-26 - Imported-word browse course exposed in Courses tab
- Current status:
  - 鐎电厧鍙嗙拠宥嗙湽濞村繗顫嶉敓?is now visible in /(tabs)/courses under the default ll category and routes to /imported-word-course.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - Entry is currently a fixed local card, not backend-configurable course metadata.
- Next concrete work item:
  - If needed, migrate this card to backend course registry so it can be managed with other course items.
## 2026-03-26 - Hotfix for home tab compile block
- Current status:
  - pp/(tabs)/index.tsx syntax around ocabSubtitle is now parse-safe; no unterminated-template compile block.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - None in code; only potential local cache residue on developer machine.
- Next concrete work item:
  - If red screen remains, run Expo with cache clear and hard reload once.
## 2026-03-26 - Imported-word browse course (no exercise loading)
- Current status:
  - Learner now has a dedicated route /imported-word-course for browsing imported words only (no quiz/exercise rendering).
  - Data source reads imported lexical assets via pipelineApi.listLexicalLearningEntries() with local-storage fallback.
  - Home tab includes a direct entry card to this browse course.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - Not yet surfaced in learning-modules registry list.
  - No learner progress/bookmark state is recorded yet for this browse flow.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Decide whether to add this route into module registry and whether to add lightweight progress markers (last viewed word/bookmark).
## 2026-03-20 - Mongo lexical option migration + higher-quality distractor rules
- Current status:
  - Added backend migration script `duoxx_server/scripts/migrate-lexical-quiz-options-v1.js` to rewrite legacy `translation_choice / word_card` options using the latest translation-choice rules.
  - Added backend helper `duoxx_server/src/services/lexicalQuizOptionRules.js` and test coverage so migration dry-run and future option normalization use explicit Chinese-translation-only rules.
  - Server-side and local fallback distractor selection now prioritize same part of speech first, then closer difficulty, then overlapping scene tags, while excluding `true/false`, duplicates, and the correct answer.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - Existing Mongo records are not rewritten until the migration is run with `--apply`; only dry-run validation has been executed so far.
  - The backend service and the frontend fallback still keep similar rule logic in separate files; they now behave consistently but are not yet physically deduplicated across runtimes.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Run `npm --prefix duoxx_server run migrate:lexical-quiz-options-v1 -- --apply` against the target environment after reviewing the dry-run samples, then smoke-test one migrated lexical course in the learner.
## 2026-03-20 - Exercise Review approve-and-activate simplification
- Current status:
  - Exercise Review now uses a single primary action: 閿熸枻鎷峰噯閿熸枻鎷烽敓鏂ゆ嫹鏁?
  - Already-active questions no longer show a second activation button; they display 閿熸枻鎷峰墠閿熸枻鎷?instead.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - The backend still keeps separate approve/activate endpoints internally; the simplification is currently a UI-level orchestration.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Decide whether the backend should gain a dedicated pprove-and-activate endpoint or whether the current UI composition is sufficient.
## 2026-03-20 - Exercise Review semantic simplification
- Current status:
  - Exercise Review no longer exposes 閿熸枻鎷烽敓鏂ゆ嫹閿熸枻鎷?/ 閿熸枻鎷锋€侀敓鏂ゆ嫹 / 閿熸枻鎷峰墠閿熻姤鏈?in the operator UI.
  - The panel now groups by 閿熸枻鎷烽敓鏂ゆ嫹 on the left and shows all exercises under the selected sense on the right.
  - The generic 閿熸枻鎷烽敓缂寸尨鎷烽€?action has been replaced with explicit 閿熸枻鎷烽敓鏂ゆ嫹閫夐敓鏂ゆ嫹閿熸枻鎷?and 閿熸枻鎷烽敓鏂ゆ嫹閿熷彨璁规嫹閿熸枻鎷?actions.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - Backend data still keeps quiz versioning internally; the UI now hides that model instead of deleting it.
  - Learning-side quiz consumption still has not switched to the active lexical quiz endpoint.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Run a browser smoke test for /admin/pipeline -> Exercise Review, then decide whether 閿熸枻鎷蜂负閿熸枻鎷锋晥閿熸枻鎷?should be auto-triggered on approve.
## 2026-03-20 - Import panel session persistence
- Current status:
  - `Import & Review` now restores uploaded file name, parsed review result, selected entry, and status after tab switches.
  - A local session store was added for the import panel only.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - This does not alter backend quiz APIs or data persistence for imported quiz content.
- Next concrete work item:
  - If needed, wire any additional import UI fields into the same session store; otherwise leave the scope limited to the current restored fields.
## 2026-03-20 - Exercise Review panel encoding fix
- Current status:
  - `Exercise Review` UI labels were rewritten into a UTF-8-safe config and the panel source was rewritten to remove mojibake.
  - Backend quiz lifecycle remains unchanged.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - Old imported quiz content can still be garbled if it was created from earlier corrupted template data.
- Next concrete work item:
  - If the page still shows bad quiz text after a hard refresh, re-import or clear the stale seed/local review data source that fed those records.
## 2026-03-23 - Exercise Review duplicate quiz dedupe
- Current status:
  - Exercise Review now deduplicates identical quizzes by semantic signature before rendering, so a seed/generated pair with the same visible question no longer appears twice.
  - Backend generation now skips writing duplicate quizzes when the new question would be visually identical to an existing seed or generated item.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - Existing duplicate records remain in Mongo, but they are now hidden by list dedupe and no longer get regenerated.
  - The learner side has not been smoke-tested against a duplicate-heavy course after this backend change.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Run one admin import/review + learner smoke path on a course that previously showed duplicate judgment questions, then decide whether to backfill a Mongo cleanup script for historical duplicates.
# Project Progress

Last updated: 2026-03-20

## Current Focus
- V5 single-file lexical asset import is the default operator flow.
- Markdown is the primary template; CSV/TXT are compatibility inputs.
- 閿熺粸浼欐嫹閿熸枻鎷烽敓鏂ゆ嫹閿熸枻鎷烽敓鏂ゆ嫹閿熺Ц鍖℃嫹涓虹郴缁熼敓鏂ゆ嫹閿熺即锝忔嫹`閿熸枻鎷烽敓鏂ゆ嫹閫夐敓鏂ゆ嫹閿熸枻鎷?/ 閿熷彨璁规嫹閿熸枻鎷穈閿熸枻鎷?
## Done
- Single-file import and review page is live in `/admin/pipeline`.
- Word/phrase headwords, multiple senses, translated facets, and translated examples are supported.

- Generated quiz versions, active quiz bindings, and stale marking are now implemented in backend Mongo collections, with local AsyncStorage fallback still kept as a dev safety net.
- `Exercise Review` now hosts the lexical quiz version review panel with `Seed / Generated / Active / Stale` filters and approve/reject/activate/generate actions.
- Vocab lesson routes now prefer `/api/learning/lexical-quizzes/active` for `multiple_choice` and `true_false` quiz playback, with automatic fallback to the existing lesson payload when no usable active lexical quiz exists.
- The main admin page no longer exposes the old V4 multi-file import flow by default.
- `lexical-quiz-lifecycle-v1.md` now defines where dynamic quiz updates should be stored and how admins should review them.
- Progress tracking is now mandatory in both `PROJECT_MEMORY.md` and `PROJECT_PROGRESS.md`.
- The unused V4 lexical import implementation and its test/config files have been removed from the Expo repo.
- Backend learning route now exposes `/api/learning/lexical-quizzes/active` for current active lexical quiz reads.
- `Exercise Review` 閿熸枻鎷烽敓鏂ゆ嫹閿熸枻鎷烽敓鏂ゆ嫹 `閿熸枻鎷烽敓缂村嚖鎷烽敓鏂ゆ嫹閫夐敓鏂ゆ嫹閿熸枻鎷?/ 閿熸枻鎷烽敓鏂ゆ嫹閿熷彨璁规嫹閿熸枻鎷穈閿熸枻鎷烽敓鏂ゆ嫹閿熷姭甯嫹 `word_card` 閿熸枻鎷烽敓鏂ゆ嫹閿熸枻鎷烽敓鏂ゆ嫹閿熸枻鎷烽敓鏂ゆ嫹閿熼叺鈽呮嫹

- The frontend still keeps local lexical quiz storage as fallback; once backend stability is confirmed, that fallback can be reduced or removed.

## Next Steps
- Decide whether the learner should keep reusing the current multiple-choice renderer for `translation_choice` or gain a dedicated lexical-card layout.
- Decide whether to keep or remove the frontend local lexical quiz fallback after backend smoke testing.
- Remove or archive the remaining legacy candidate-review code after the Mongo-backed lexical quiz path is stable.

## 2026-03-20 - Lexical quiz V2 contraction to knowledge-first + system-generated questions
- Current status:
  - Official Markdown/TXT/CSV lexical templates now only demonstrate knowledge assets; hand-written quiz blocks were removed from the operator-facing templates.
  - `Exercise Review` now treats `translation_choice` as the formal word-meaning exercise type and uses explicit buttons: `閿熸枻鎷烽敓缂村嚖鎷烽敓鏂ゆ嫹閫夐敓鏂ゆ嫹閿熸枻鎷?/ 閿熸枻鎷烽敓鏂ゆ嫹閿熷彨璁规嫹閿熸枻鎷穈.
  - Learner-side active lexical quiz playback now formally supports `translation_choice`, while legacy `word_card / multiple_choice` payloads are mapped into the same path for compatibility.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - Backend and local storage still retain internal `seed/generated/version` structures; those are hidden from the operator UI but not yet renamed internally.
  - The import parser still accepts legacy quiz blocks for compatibility, even though the official template no longer promotes them.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Run a live end-to-end smoke test: import a knowledge-only markdown file, save assets to Mongo, generate one translation-choice quiz, approve it, and confirm the learner reads it from `/api/learning/lexical-quizzes/active`.

## 2026-03-20 - Learning-side active lexical quiz hookup
- Current status:
  - `app/lesson-exercise/[lessonId].tsx` now checks `GET /api/learning/lexical-quizzes/active` first for vocab routes and converts usable active quizzes into `LessonEngine` exercises.
  - If the active lexical quiz pool is empty or contains only unsupported quiz types, the screen falls back to the existing backend lesson payload without breaking the old course flow.
  - Adaptive session startup remains disabled for this lexical-active path so the new quiz source does not fight the existing adaptive lesson contract.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - This learner-side path still renders `word_card` as a meaning multiple-choice exercise; there is not yet a dedicated flashcard-style interaction.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Decide whether `word_card` should stay as a meaning multiple-choice shortcut or graduate into its own dedicated learner interaction.

## 2026-03-20 - Mongo persistence feedback + Exercise Review status copy
- Current status:
  - `Import & Review` now explicitly tells operators whether `閿熸枻鎷烽敓鏂ゆ嫹閿熺粸璇ф嫹閿熻淇濋敓鏂ゆ嫹閿熸枻鎷穈 wrote to backend Mongo or fell back to local storage.
  - `Exercise Review` now reports whether quiz versions were loaded from backend Mongo or local fallback.
  - Review filter labels, status labels, quiz type labels, and generation reasons are now driven by UTF-8-safe copy config.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - If old records were imported from corrupted source text, item content itself can still look bad until re-imported.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Re-run `閿熸枻鎷烽敓鏂ゆ嫹閿熺粸璇ф嫹閿熻淇濋敓鏂ゆ嫹閿熸枻鎷穈 after restarting backend, confirm status says backend Mongo, then verify `lexicalAssets` and `seedQuizzes` collections receive documents.

## 2026-03-20 - Lexical quiz API path fix + import session persistence
- Current status:
  - Lexical quiz review/import API calls now consistently target `/api/pipeline/...` and `/api/learning/...`, fixing the earlier 404 path mismatch that forced silent local fallback.
  - `Import & Review` now persists its local session across tab switches and shows whether seed save hit backend Mongo or local fallback.
  - `Exercise Review` also shows whether the current quiz list came from backend Mongo or local fallback.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - Need a live operator smoke test after backend restart to confirm Mongo receives `lexicalAssets` and `seedQuizzes`.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Re-open `/admin/pipeline`, import a lexical asset file, click `閿熸枻鎷烽敓鏂ゆ嫹閿熺粸璇ф嫹閿熻淇濋敓鏂ゆ嫹閿熸枻鎷穈, confirm the status says backend Mongo, then verify the two Mongo collections contain documents.

## 2026-03-20 - Import & Review left list compactness
- Current status:
  - The left lexical entry list in `LexicalAssetImportPanel.tsx` now shows `鐠囧秵鈧溇 | 娓氬褰瀤` on the same line as the title and uses smaller vertical padding/margins.
  - This change is presentation-only; parsing, save behavior, and API paths remain unchanged.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - No business-logic changes were made by request.
- Next concrete work item:
  - If needed, further tighten left-rail typography and badge sizing after a browser smoke test.
## 2026-03-20 - Import review list compaction
- Current status:
  - Import review left-side word rows now show `閿熸枻鎷烽敓鏂ゆ嫹 x | 閿熸枻鎷烽敓鏂ゆ嫹 x` inline beside the headword instead of taking a second summary line.
  - Entry row vertical spacing has been tightened to reduce wasted height in the review list.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - A live browser check is still needed to confirm the compact row density feels right with real long words and issue badges.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Verify the compact list with a real imported markdown asset and adjust widths only if count text wraps too aggressively.
## 2026-03-20 - Exercise Review compactness + version-copy cleanup
- Current status:
  - The Exercise Review panel now groups quiz items by sense and uses a denser left list with shorter row height.
  - Display copy avoids version-like labels in the main UI, and the active-state wording is simplified to `瑜版挸澧犳０姒?/ `瀹稿弶娴涢幑顣?
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - Need a browser smoke test on real imported assets to confirm the tighter list still reads well.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Run the admin page with real quiz data, check the compressed grouped list, and trim widths only if labels wrap awkwardly.

## 2026-03-20 - Lexical practice answer-validation investigation and option normalization
- Current status:
  - Browser-level verification on `/lesson-exercise/vocab-course-...` confirmed the learner does not actually mark every option correct; wrong selections still produce `閿熸枻鎷烽敓鏂ゆ嫹涓€閿熸枻鎷穈.
  - Root cause was lexical option quality, not validator failure:
    - legacy `word_card` compatibility could pull `true/false` answers into translation distractors
    - translation-choice options kept the correct answer pinned too predictably at the first slot
  - Frontend lexical quiz adapter now filters legacy distractors to translation-like Chinese answers only and rotates options deterministically so the correct answer is not always first.
  - Local storage generation and backend Mongo generation now apply the same deterministic option rotation for new `translation_choice` questions.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - Existing active quiz records in Mongo keep their stored option order; the learner adapter normalizes them at read time, but no data migration has been run yet.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Decide whether to run a one-off Mongo migration to rewrite old `translation_choice` and promoted legacy `word_card` option arrays into the new normalized order.

## 2026-03-20 - Translation-choice distractor quality upgrade
- Current status:
  - `duoxx_server/src/services/lexicalQuizService.js` now scores translation-choice distractors with explicit priority for same part of speech, then difficulty proximity, then scene-tag overlap.
  - `duoxx/src/storage/lexicalQuizReviewStorage.ts` uses the same scoring rules for local generation so backend and fallback stay aligned.
  - Non-translation distractors are filtered out; ASCII-only `true/false` style candidates no longer enter translation-choice option pools.
  - New tests cover the higher-quality distractor selection path on both backend generation and local storage generation.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - Existing saved quiz records are not migrated; the new rules apply to new generation and to read-time normalization.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Optionally run a one-off data cleanup later if old stored translation-choice rows should also be rewritten in place.

## 2026-03-26 - Learning tab IA simplification (task-first)
- Current status:
  - Home tab non-parent mode now renders as three sections: `閿熸枻鎷峰涔犺矾閿熸枻鎷穈 / `閿熸枻鎷烽敓鏂ゆ嫹鏁仾鐧?/ `瀛︿範閿熸枻鎷锋簮`.
  - Repeated `瀛︿範閿熸枻鎷烽敓鏂ゆ嫹` entry in resource cards was removed; diagnostic actions are now閿熸枻鎷烽敓鏂ゆ嫹閿熸枻鎷?`閿熸枻鎷烽敓鏂ゆ嫹鏁仾鐧?閿熸枻鎷烽敓鏂ゆ嫹.
  - Old `瀛︿範缁熼敓鏂ゆ嫹` block was removed from first screen to reduce visual load.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - No in-device visual QA screenshots yet for narrow screens and CHILD/STUDENT mode spacing.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Run RN device smoke checks for Home tab (Adult + Child + Student), then tune spacing if diagnostic block appears crowded.
## 2026-03-26 - Learning tab compact-mode optimization
- Current status:
  - Home tab now has responsive compact layout (`width < 390`) with stacked diagnostic cards/actions and tighter section spacing.
  - CHILD/STUDENT mode now uses medium avatar + smaller heart icons on compact screens to avoid crowding.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - No screenshot-based device QA record yet for 360/375 widths.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Run visual smoke tests on narrow devices and fine-tune subtitle truncation/line-clamp rules if still crowded.

## 2026-03-27 - CEO review retry (project-wide gaps and execution order)
- Current status:
  - Re-ran baseline checks from existing logs: duoxx/lint-full.log still reports 331 problems (81 errors, 250 warnings), and duoxx/tsc-full.log still reports 25 blocking TypeScript errors.
  - Critical blockers remain clustered in module exports/contracts and dependency mismatch (expo-blur missing, expo-speech previously flagged by audit).
  - Current admin/pipeline iteration speed improved, but engineering baseline (type safety + lint pass) is still below a safe acceleration threshold.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - No full green CI baseline (lint, tsc, test) yet, so feature velocity is constrained by regression risk.
  - Home tab IA has been simplified, but no unified design token/system enforcement yet, so UI consistency can drift across screens.
  - Data contract governance is not yet strict enough to fully prevent malformed or duplicate content at import/publish boundaries.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Execute P0 stabilization sprint in this order: (1) dependency parity, (2) export/index cleanup, (3) route typing fixes, (4) failing type contracts, (5) targeted smoke tests on pipeline and learning primary flows.

## 2026-03-27 - P0 stabilization execution (blocking errors cleared)
- Current status:
  - TypeScript blocking errors were reduced from 25 to 0 (`cmd /c npx tsc --noEmit` passed).
  - ESLint blocking errors were reduced from 76 to 0 (`npm run lint` now reports `0 errors, 248 warnings`).
  - Survival Phrases typed routes were restored by adding missing Expo Router files under `app/modules/survival-phrases/*`.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - Lint warnings remain large (248), mostly hooks deps / unused vars / import ordering and BOM warnings.
  - End-to-end smoke test for admin pipeline + learner lexical flow is still pending in this round.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Start warning-burndown batch by domain (`admin`, `speaking-avatar`, `dynamic-lexicon`) and keep `0 lint errors` invariant.

## 2026-03-27 - Warning burndown completion (lint clean)
- Current status:
  - ESLint warnings were reduced from 248 to 0; `npm run lint` now returns fully clean output.
  - TypeScript remains green after cleanup (`cmd /c npx tsc --noEmit` passed).
  - Targeted regression tests for touched areas passed:
    - `AnimationEngine.test.ts`
    - `SpeakingAvatarController.test.ts`
    - `ScenarioValidator.test.ts`
    - `PhraseManager.test.ts`
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - Full-app test suite was not run in this pass; verification was targeted to changed modules.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Run broader smoke/QA on primary learner flows and admin pipeline flow to confirm no runtime UI regressions after cleanup.

## 2026-04-02 - AGENTS constitution update (development-first engineering rules)
- Current status:
  - Added `Development-Phase Constitution (Mandatory)` in `AGENTS.md`.
  - New guardrails: architecture/code clarity first, no minimal-diff bias, no workaround/fallback padding in default development work.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - Policy is documented, but no automated enforcement tooling is configured.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Apply the new constitution in the next implementation task and reject workaround-style proposals by default.

## 2026-04-02 - AGENTS.md quality pass (clarity and enforceability)
- Current status:
  - AGENTS.md was structurally optimized for developer-agent execution.
  - Added explicit rule priority, removed duplicated session-persistence wording, and clarified that commands run under duoxx/ by default.
  - Replaced the file-organization tree with ASCII-safe formatting.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - No automated lint/check exists yet to validate AGENTS policy consistency.
- Next concrete work item:
  - In next workflow update, optionally add a lightweight AGENTS consistency checklist script.

## 2026-04-02 - Lexicon graph auto-first pipeline (strict gate + minimal manual)
- Current status:
  - Backend lexicon graph contract and routes are in place for import/review/publish and learning consumption.
  - Admin `LexicalAssetImportPanel` now supports:
    - batch creation from parsed lexical review
    - quality report and pending-candidate retrieval
    - tri-action candidate decisions (`闁俺绻?/ 閹锋帞绮?/ 閸氬牆鑻焋)
    - auto-publish when pending candidates are zero
  - Learner `imported-word-course` now supports graph-style navigation:
    - expansion click promotes target to main node
    - grouped expansion browsing, back navigation, return-to-root
    - `閻旂喐鍊?閹哄本褰檂 marking and recommendation refresh
  - Vocab completion scoring now uses composite score:
    - `final_score = 0.65*answer_accuracy + 0.35*mastery_progress`
    - quick-mark finish-state race is fixed, avoiding stale completion params.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - Frontend `lexiconApi` still returns loosely typed payloads in several call sites.
  - No full e2e regression test yet for the complete lexicon graph operator->learner chain.
  - Legacy lexical seed-quiz import side-effect is still retained as compatibility behavior.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Add end-to-end smoke/e2e case for: import -> candidate decision -> publish -> learner graph expand/mark/recommend loop.
  - Add strict TS response interfaces for lexicon APIs and remove ad-hoc casts from UI.
  - Evaluate removal plan for legacy seed-quiz side-effect once graph flow is stable in production-like usage.

## 2026-04-02 - Lexicon API strict typing + route smoke loop
- Current status:
  - `duoxx/src/services/lexiconApi.ts` now exports explicit contract types for import/report/candidate/publish/graph/mark/recommend payloads.
  - `duoxx/app/imported-word-course.tsx` and `duoxx/components/admin/LexicalAssetImportPanel.tsx` now consume typed responses directly and removed ad-hoc response casts.
  - Added backend route smoke test `duoxx_server_link/src/routes/lexiconGraphFlow.test.js` covering:
    - import batch -> candidate review -> publish
    - learner graph node/expand read
    - mastery mark + recommendation refresh
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - This smoke test validates route orchestration with stateful service mocks; it is not a real DB-integrated e2e yet.
  - Legacy seed-quiz side-effect (`pipelineApi.importSeedQuizzesFromLexicalReview`) is still retained for compatibility.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Add one DB-backed integration test (or staging smoke script) for strict gate behavior with real persisted edges/nodes.
  - Plan and execute removal of legacy seed-quiz side-effect after confirming graph-only operator flow in production-like usage.

## 2026-04-02 - Lexicon strict-gate DB integration test landed
- Current status:
  - Added `mongodb-memory-server` dev dependency in `duoxx_server_link/package.json` (and lockfile updated) for real Mongo persistence integration testing.
  - Added `duoxx_server_link/src/services/__tests__/lexiconGraphService.integration.test.js`:
    - imports a real batch into Mongo
    - verifies strict gate blocks publish while candidates are pending
    - approves pending candidate and verifies publish succeeds
    - verifies active snapshot persisted and learner-side service methods (`getNode/expand/mark/recommend`) read expected data
  - Combined verification now passes:
    - route smoke tests + new DB integration test
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - This DB integration currently targets service-level orchestration, not full HTTP+auth+DB e2e.
  - Legacy seed-quiz compatibility side-effect still exists in admin import flow.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Add one HTTP-level e2e test on top of memory Mongo (pipeline+learning routes with auth middleware) to complete full-chain verification.
  - Start implementing deprecation/removal plan for legacy seed-quiz side-effect after one staging validation round.

## 2026-04-02 - Lexicon HTTP+DB e2e + legacy side-effect removal
- Current status:
  - Added full HTTP+DB e2e test `duoxx_server_link/src/routes/lexiconGraph.e2e.test.js` (memory Mongo + real pipeline/learning routes):
    - import batch
    - strict gate publish blocked before review
    - candidate approve
    - publish success
    - learner graph read/expand + mastery mark + recommendations
  - Removed legacy seed-quiz import side-effect from admin graph import flow:
    - `duoxx/components/admin/LexicalAssetImportPanel.tsx` no longer calls `pipelineApi.importSeedQuizzesFromLexicalReview(review)` during graph batch creation.
  - Route smoke + DB integration + new HTTP e2e are now all green.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - Legacy seed-quiz endpoints and storage path still exist in backend codebase, but are no longer triggered by the graph import panel.
  - No staging telemetry yet on operator behavior after side-effect removal.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Observe one staging cycle for graph import and learner recommendation flow to confirm no hidden dependency on old seed-quiz write path.
  - Then remove/archive remaining legacy seed-quiz import code and update operator docs accordingly.

## 2026-04-02 - Legacy seed-quiz import endpoint retired
- Current status:
  - Frontend `pipelineApi` no longer exports legacy `importSeedQuizzesFromLexicalReview` method.
  - Backend `/api/pipeline/seed-quizzes/import-from-lexical-review` route has been removed from `pipeline.js`.
  - Backend `lexicalQuizService.importFromLexicalReview` and its dedicated helper code were removed; quiz review APIs remain available for existing generated/seed data.
  - Added regression guard in `pipeline.test.js`: posting legacy endpoint now returns `404`.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - Legacy seed-quiz storage schema (`LexicalAsset` / `SeedQuiz`) still exists for compatibility and historical data reads.
  - Operator docs have not yet been explicitly updated to state that graph import is now the only supported import path.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Update operator-facing docs to mark legacy seed-quiz import as retired.
  - Plan archival/removal scope for remaining unused seed-quiz storage/write paths after staging observation.

## 2026-04-02 - Graph-only contract docs sync + legacy path labeling
- Current status:
  - Updated `duoxx/docs/lexical-quiz-lifecycle-v1.md` to the current graph-first lifecycle contract and marked legacy seed-quiz path as compatibility-only.
  - Added `duoxx/docs/seed-quiz-legacy-retirement-plan.md` with phased retirement workflow (observe -> deprecate UI -> retire writes -> archive -> final removal).
  - Updated admin/operator-facing wording:
    - `OperatorWorkbench` tab label now shows `Exercise Review (Legacy)`.
    - `pipelineApi` and backend routes now include explicit comments that legacy quiz APIs are compatibility paths, not default flow.
  - Synced README notes in both app and server repos to explicitly document graph import APIs and retired seed import endpoint.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - Legacy quiz collections and compatibility endpoints are still present for historical reads.
  - No staging telemetry window has been executed yet for final removal decision.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Run one staging observation cycle and collect endpoint usage for `/api/pipeline/quizzes*` and `/api/learning/lexical-quizzes/active`.
  - If usage is zero or acceptable, start Phase 2/3 retirement from `seed-quiz-legacy-retirement-plan.md`.

## 2026-04-02 - Operator default nav hides legacy Exercise Review
- Current status:
  - `OperatorWorkbench` main tab row no longer exposes `Exercise Review` as a default entry.
  - Legacy review code path is kept in codebase for compatibility, but operators now enter graph flow from `Import` by default.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - Legacy review component is still present and can still be reached only if tab state is set programmatically.
- Next concrete work item:
  - In the next cleanup phase, remove legacy review component mount block and related state/actions after staging confirms no dependency.

## 2026-04-02 - Staging observe round #1 (real HTTP flow)
- Current status:
  - Ran one full real-HTTP observation loop against running backend (`http://localhost:3000`):
    - auth register/login (operator)
    - graph import batch create
    - strict gate block before review (`409 LEXICON_QUALITY_GATE_BLOCKED`)
    - candidate approve decisions
    - publish success with snapshot
    - learner graph read/expand + mastery mark + recommendation refresh
  - Key observed results:
    - batch created: `pending_review=2`
    - publish before review: blocked as expected
    - publish after review: success (`snapshotVersion` generated)
    - mastery mark write/read loop: success
  - Legacy probes in same round:
    - retired endpoint `/api/pipeline/seed-quizzes/import-from-lexical-review` -> `404` (expected)
    - compatibility endpoints still return data:
      - `/api/pipeline/quizzes` -> `200`, data count `24`
      - `/api/learning/lexical-quizzes/active` -> `200`, data count `4`
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - This round validates API behavior, but does not yet provide passive traffic usage telemetry from real operator sessions.
  - Legacy compatibility endpoints still serve data, so immediate hard removal remains risky.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Add endpoint usage counters/log aggregation for `/api/pipeline/quizzes*` and `/api/learning/lexical-quizzes/active` over a staging window.
  - If observed real traffic is near-zero, proceed with Phase 2/3 retirement.

## 2026-04-03 - Enforce manual-trigger only for lexicon import/publish (no timer/scheduled publish)
- Current status:
  - Removed auto-publish behavior from `LexicalAssetImportPanel` after batch creation.
  - Import flow now stops at `batch ready` and requires explicit human click on `Publish`.
  - Cleaned broken string/render lines introduced during edit and restored full compile health.
  - Removed `scheduled_refresh` from `GeneratedQuizVersion.generationReason` enum to prevent future timed-generation semantics from being written.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - Legacy compatibility read endpoints still exist (`/api/pipeline/quizzes*`, `/api/learning/lexical-quizzes/active`) and are outside this manual-trigger change.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Continue legacy endpoint usage observation window, then retire compatibility write/review paths by phase plan.

## 2026-04-03 - System test baseline step #1 (automation + smoke precheck)
- Current status:
  - Frontend baseline check passed:
    - `cmd /c npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false` (duoxx) -> pass.
  - Backend stable route-suite baseline passed:
    - `node_modules\\.bin\\jest.cmd src/routes/pipeline.test.js src/routes/learning.test.js src/routes/lexiconGraphFlow.test.js --runInBand` -> pass (3 suites / 15 tests).
  - Backend deep integration/e2e suites were blocked by environment dependency, not business assertion:
    - `src/routes/lexiconGraph.e2e.test.js`
    - `src/services/__tests__/lexiconGraphService.integration.test.js`
    - blocker: `mongodb-memory-server` first-run binary download + lockfile conflict (`C:\\Users\\Administrator\\.cache\\mongodb-binaries\\8.2.1.lock`) causing hook timeout and cleanup errors.
  - Authenticated API smoke in this shell is currently blocked by local auth/data mismatch:
    - register flow hits `E11000 ... email_1/phone_1 dup key: { ...: null }` in running backend (cannot create fresh smoke user via `/api/auth/register`).
    - existing admin/operator credentials are required to continue protected endpoint smoke from this environment.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - Full authenticated staging smoke loop cannot be re-run end-to-end in this shell until one valid existing account is available (or auth null-unique index issue is fixed in running env).
  - `mongodb-memory-server` cache lock issue prevents reliable local execution of heavy integration/e2e suites.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Unblock one of:
    - provide a staging admin/operator test account for smoke script, or
    - fix/register-path null-unique-index behavior in running backend and rerun.
  - Clear mongodb-memory-server cache lock and rerun integration/e2e suites to complete baseline gate.

## 2026-04-03 - System test baseline step #1 completed (deep suites recovered)
- Current status:
  - Cleared corrupted Mongo memory-server cache artifacts under `C:\\Users\\Administrator\\.cache\\mongodb-binaries`, then reran deep suites successfully:
    - `src/services/__tests__/lexiconGraphService.integration.test.js` -> pass.
    - `src/routes/lexiconGraph.e2e.test.js` -> pass.
  - Stable + deep automated baseline now all green for graph core path:
    - frontend type gate pass,
    - backend route suites pass,
    - backend integration/e2e pass.
  - Runtime API smoke (without operator credentials) confirms learner read/expand/mark chain is live on current server:
    - `/health` -> 200
    - `/api/learning/recommendations` -> 200
    - `/api/learning/graph/node/:id` -> 200
    - `/api/learning/graph/node/:id/expand` -> 200
    - `/api/learning/mastery/mark` -> 200 (guest mode)
  - Operator-protected import endpoint auth gate is active:
    - `/api/pipeline/lexicon/import-batches` without token -> 401.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - Real runtime operator import/review/publish smoke against the running staging server is still blocked by missing reusable admin/operator credentials from this shell.
  - Running server `/api/auth/register` currently returns null-unique-index duplicate-key errors in this environment, so smoke account bootstrap cannot rely on register API.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Step #2 staging business-chain鐟欏倹绁?
    - use existing operator account to run import -> candidate decision -> manual publish once,
    - then verify learner recommendations and legacy compatibility endpoint status.

## 2026-04-03 - Staging business-chain observe round #2 (operator account)
- Current status:
  - Used real operator account to run one full graph flow on running backend:
    - login -> import batch -> report -> publish gate block -> candidate decisions -> manual publish -> learner read/expand/mark.
  - Observed key runtime results:
    - import batch: `lexbatch_word_1775185968198_md_mnibw3fg`
    - import stats: `nodes=21`, `edges=14`, `pendingReview=6`
    - strict gate blocked before review: yes
    - reviewed/approved candidates: `6/6`
    - publish success snapshot: `lexicon_snapshot_mnibw3os`
    - learner recommendations: count `5`
    - root node probe `node_ws_run_v_1_1775185968198`: node `200`, `expand(all)=9`, `expand(synonyms)=2`
    - mastery mark write: success
  - Legacy path probe in same round:
    - retired seed import endpoint: `404` (expected)
    - compatibility endpoints still serving:
      - `/api/pipeline/quizzes`: `200`, count `24`
      - `/api/learning/lexical-quizzes/active`: `200`, count `4`
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - Legacy compatibility read endpoints still have data and are not yet retired.
  - `strict gate` error payload in this runtime did not return a stable `code` field every time, only block behavior.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Keep graph-only workflow as default and continue compatibility endpoint usage observation before final legacy removal.
  - If removal window starts, add response contract assertion for strict-gate blocked code consistency.

## 2026-04-03 - System test step #3 (compatibility + retirement risk check)
- Current status:
  - Runtime contract checks:
    - strict quality gate publish block returns `409`, and error payload includes code `LEXICON_QUALITY_GATE_BLOCKED`.
    - legacy compatibility routes are auth-protected at runtime:
      - `/api/pipeline/quizzes` -> `401` without token, `200` with operator token.
      - retired `/api/pipeline/seed-quizzes/import-from-lexical-review` -> `401` without token, `404` with token.
  - Static dependency scan (frontend) found active callers still depending on legacy compatibility APIs:
    - `app/lesson-exercise/[lessonId].tsx` calls `learningApi.getActiveLexicalQuizzes()` for `vocab-*` lessons.
    - `components/admin/LexicalQuizReviewPanel.tsx` still calls legacy quiz review/generate/approve/reject/activate APIs.
    - `src/services/learningApi.ts` and `src/services/pipelineApi.ts` still expose legacy compatibility methods.
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - Legacy compatibility endpoints cannot be hard-retired yet without breaking:
    - learner lexical route for `vocab-*`,
    - admin legacy review panel behavior.
  - Current system is graph-first by default flow, but not graph-only at code dependency level.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Step #4 Go/No-Go report:
    - **Go** for graph-first rollout and manual-trigger import/publish policy,
    - **No-Go** for final legacy endpoint removal until `lesson-exercise` lexical path is migrated off `/api/learning/lexical-quizzes/active`.

## 2026-04-03 - Step #4 execution started (learner `vocab-*` route migrated to graph recommendations)
- Current status:
  - Implemented first retirement blocker removal on learner side:
    - `app/lesson-exercise/[lessonId].tsx` no longer calls `learningApi.getActiveLexicalQuizzes()` for `vocab-*` lessons.
    - `vocab-*` lessons now call `lexiconGraphApi.getRecommendations()` and build exercises from graph recommendations.
  - Added new adapter:
    - `src/services/lexiconRecommendationLessonAdapter.ts`
    - converts graph recommendation nodes into `MULTIPLE_CHOICE` lesson exercises (question = `word | pos`, answer/options from node definitions and recommendation pool).
  - Added unit tests:
    - `src/services/__tests__/lexiconRecommendationLessonAdapter.test.ts` (2 cases pass).
- Verification:
  - `cmd /c npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false` (duoxx) -> pass
  - `cmd /c npx eslint app/lesson-exercise/[lessonId].tsx src/services/lexiconRecommendationLessonAdapter.ts src/services/__tests__/lexiconRecommendationLessonAdapter.test.ts --max-warnings=0` -> pass
  - `cmd /c npx jest src/services/__tests__/lexiconRecommendationLessonAdapter.test.ts --runInBand` -> pass
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - Admin legacy review panel (`LexicalQuizReviewPanel`) and `pipelineApi` legacy quiz review actions still depend on `/api/pipeline/quizzes*`.
  - `learningApi.getActiveLexicalQuizzes` wrapper still exists (currently no remaining app caller after this change).
- Next concrete work item:
  - Continue step #4 by migrating admin legacy review path off `/api/pipeline/quizzes*`, then re-run compatibility scan for final retirement readiness.

## 2026-04-03 - Step #4 follow-up (admin legacy review panel detached from workbench render path)
- Current status:
  - Removed legacy review panel render mount from operator main workbench:
    - `components/admin/OperatorWorkbench.tsx` no longer imports or renders `LexicalQuizReviewPanel`.
    - `Tab` union dropped `exercises` branch.
  - This removes active runtime caller path to `pipelineApi` legacy quiz review actions from default/admin UI flow.
  - Compatibility scan after this change shows legacy endpoint strings remain only in:
    - legacy panel source file (`LexicalQuizReviewPanel.tsx`, now unmounted),
    - compatibility API wrapper methods (`learningApi.ts`, `pipelineApi.ts`),
    - retirement docs.
- Verification:
  - `cmd /c npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false` (duoxx) -> pass
  - `cmd /c npx eslint components/admin/OperatorWorkbench.tsx app/lesson-exercise/[lessonId].tsx src/services/lexiconRecommendationLessonAdapter.ts src/services/__tests__/lexiconRecommendationLessonAdapter.test.ts --max-warnings=0` -> pass
  - `cmd /c npx jest src/services/__tests__/lexiconRecommendationLessonAdapter.test.ts --runInBand` -> pass
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - Legacy API wrapper methods are still present in `pipelineApi.ts` / `learningApi.ts`.
  - Legacy panel source file still exists, but has no active mount in operator workbench.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Final cleanup phase:
    - remove/retire unused legacy wrapper methods and dead panel file,
    - then run one more compatibility scan + staging smoke and issue final legacy endpoint retirement recommendation.

## 2026-04-03 - Step #4 cleanup completed (legacy wrappers removed from runtime app code)
- Current status:
  - Removed unused legacy compatibility wrappers from app service layer:
    - deleted `getActiveLexicalQuizzes` from `src/services/learningApi.ts`
    - deleted legacy quiz review/action wrappers from `src/services/pipelineApi.ts`:
      - `listLexicalQuizReviewItems`
      - `generateLexicalQuizVersions`
      - `approveLexicalQuizReviewItem`
      - `rejectLexicalQuizReviewItem`
      - `activateLexicalQuizReviewItem`
      - `listActiveLexicalQuizzes`
  - Replaced `components/admin/LexicalQuizReviewPanel.tsx` with a minimal retired placeholder component (no API side effects).
  - Compatibility endpoint grep in frontend code now only hits documentation; no runtime code references remain for:
    - `/api/pipeline/quizzes*`
    - `/api/learning/lexical-quizzes/active`
- Verification:
  - `cmd /c npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false` (duoxx) -> pass
  - `cmd /c npx eslint app/lesson-exercise/[lessonId].tsx components/admin/OperatorWorkbench.tsx components/admin/LexicalQuizReviewPanel.tsx src/services/learningApi.ts src/services/pipelineApi.ts src/services/lexiconRecommendationLessonAdapter.ts src/services/__tests__/lexiconRecommendationLessonAdapter.test.ts --max-warnings=0` -> pass
  - `cmd /c npx jest src/services/__tests__/lexiconRecommendationLessonAdapter.test.ts --runInBand` -> pass
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - Backend compatibility endpoints still exist and still return data; this step removed frontend runtime callers but did not remove backend routes.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Run one final authenticated staging smoke (graph import/review/publish + learner graph) and then produce backend legacy endpoint retirement go/no-go.

## 2026-04-03 - Final authenticated staging smoke completed (post-cleanup)
- Current status:
  - Ran full authenticated smoke after frontend legacy-wrapper cleanup:
    - login -> import -> strict gate block -> approve pending -> publish -> recommendations -> graph node/expand -> mastery mark.
  - Runtime results:
    - batch: `lexbatch_final_smoke_1775187945388_md_mnid2h15`
    - pre-publish gate: `409` + `LEXICON_QUALITY_GATE_BLOCKED`
    - pending reviewed: `2`
    - publish snapshot: `lexicon_snapshot_mnid2h4n`
    - learner graph read: node `200`, mastery mark success (`familiar`)
  - Legacy endpoint status snapshot:
    - retired seed import: `404`
    - compatibility endpoints still alive on backend:
      - `/api/pipeline/quizzes` -> `200`
      - `/api/learning/lexical-quizzes/active` -> `200`
- Final go/no-go:
  - **Go**: frontend runtime has been migrated off legacy compatibility endpoints.
  - **Conditional Go** for backend retirement: backend legacy routes can enter phased removal plan; keep rollback window because endpoints still return data.
- Next concrete work item:
  - Start backend retirement phase with safety rails:
    - add route-level deprecation logs/metrics for one short window,
    - then remove `/api/pipeline/quizzes*` and `/api/learning/lexical-quizzes/active` in controlled release.

## 2026-04-03 - Backend legacy compatibility routes removed (pipeline/learning)
- Current status:
  - Removed backend legacy quiz compatibility routes from runtime API surface:
    - `duoxx_server_link/src/routes/pipeline.js` removed:
      - `GET /quizzes`
      - `GET /quizzes/active`
      - `POST /quizzes/generate`
      - `POST /quizzes/:quizVersionId/approve`
      - `POST /quizzes/:quizVersionId/reject`
      - `POST /quizzes/:quizVersionId/activate`
    - `duoxx_server_link/src/routes/learning.js` removed:
      - `GET /lexical-quizzes/active`
  - Updated route tests to lock retirement behavior:
    - `pipeline.test.js` now asserts removed legacy quiz endpoints return `404`.
    - `learning.test.js` now asserts `/api/learning/lexical-quizzes/active` returns `404`.
  - Updated docs to reflect actual runtime state:
    - `duoxx/README.md`
    - `duoxx_server_link/README.md`
    - `duoxx/docs/lexical-quiz-lifecycle-v1.md`
- Verification:
  - Backend:
    - `$env:NODE_ENV='test'; .\\node_modules\\.bin\\jest.cmd src/routes/pipeline.test.js src/routes/learning.test.js src/routes/lexiconGraphFlow.test.js --runInBand` -> pass (3 suites / 17 tests)
  - Frontend checks from previous migration remain green (tsc/eslint/jest adapter test).
- Blocked / not yet done:
  - Running staging process still needs deployment/restart to pick up removed backend routes in live environment.
  - Legacy service module `src/services/lexicalQuizService.js` remains in repository (no runtime route binding now).
- Next concrete work item:
  - Restart/deploy backend and run one post-deploy smoke to confirm runtime 404 for removed routes.
  - Optionally archive/delete now-unbound `lexicalQuizService` + its dedicated tests in a follow-up cleanup.

## 2026-04-10 - Knowledge absorb progress now shows X/Y for active filter
- Current status:
  - `已学习` now displays as `X/Y` for the current filter instead of a global total.
  - `X` is the number of learned root cards within the active filter; `Y` is the active filter's total root count.
  - Per-filter learned counting is covered by tests in `knowledgeAbsorbProgress.test.ts`.
- Verification:
  - cmd /c "cd /d d:\\06-project\\expo_duo\\duoxx && npm test -- --runInBand src/modules/knowledge-absorb/knowledgeAbsorbProgress.test.ts src/modules/knowledge-absorb/knowledgeAbsorbEngine.test.ts"

  - node .\\duoxx\\node_modules\\typescript\\bin\\tsc --noEmit -p .\\duoxx\\tsconfig.json
## 2026-04-10 - Knowledge absorb learned stat simplified to count only
- Current status:
  - `已学习` now shows only the learned count again.
  - Current-filter learned counting logic is still preserved internally; only the denominator display was removed.
- Verification:
  - cmd /c "cd /d d:\\06-project\\expo_duo\\duoxx && npm run lint -- app/knowledge-absorb.tsx src/modules/knowledge-absorb/knowledgeAbsorbProgress.ts src/modules/knowledge-absorb/knowledgeAbsorbProgress.test.ts src/modules/knowledge-absorb/knowledgeAbsorbEngine.ts src/modules/knowledge-absorb/knowledgeAbsorbEngine.test.ts"

## 2026-04-10 - Pipeline admin graph explorer (all knowledge + fuzzy search)
- Current status:
  - `/admin/pipeline` main content area now supports view switch:
    - `课程内容`
    - `知识图谱`
  - New graph view supports:
    - scope toggle: `全部活跃节点` / `已发布快照`
    - default scope = `全部活跃节点`
    - node type filtering (includes `example` by default)
    - fuzzy search for node text fields
    - paginated node list (`30/page`)
    - node relations panel with group tabs and counts (近义词/反义词/词组/搭配/句型/口语/俚语/习语/例句/关联)
  - New backend APIs:
    - `GET /api/pipeline/lexicon/nodes`
    - `GET /api/pipeline/lexicon/nodes/:nodeId/relations`
  - In graph view, explanation review side panel is suppressed to keep one dominant task focus.
- Verification:
  - `node --check src/services/lexiconGraphService.js` (duoxx_server_link)
  - `node --check src/routes/pipeline.js` (duoxx_server_link)
  - `node --check src/routes/lexiconGraphFlow.test.js` (duoxx_server_link)
  - `npx tsc --noEmit` (duoxx)
- Notes:
  - Backend Jest was not runnable in current environment because local `cross-env` / `jest` command binaries are missing in `duoxx_server_link/node_modules`.
## 2026-04-10 - Pipeline graph `??` placeholder cleanup
- Current status:
  - Graph node definition values that are placeholder-only (`?`, `??`, `？？`, punctuation-only noise) are now sanitized in backend service output.
  - Sanitization is applied at import upsert merge + API read responses (`nodes`, `relations`, `getNode`, `expandNode`), reducing noisy placeholders in admin graph UI.
  - UI behavior remains direct render: valid text renders as-is; invalid placeholder definitions are treated as empty and show fallback `-`.
- Verification:
  - `node --check src/services/lexiconGraphService.js` (duoxx_server_link)
  - `node --check src/routes/pipeline.js` (duoxx_server_link)
  - `npx tsc --noEmit` (duoxx)
- Notes:
  - Direct Mongo inspection/counting was blocked in this session by `ECONNRESET` to local Mongo endpoint.
## 2026-04-14 - Knowledge absorb breadcrumb simplification
- Current status:
  - Removed “返回上一层” button from knowledge absorb card breadcrumb area.
  - Users now navigate hierarchy only by tapping breadcrumb items.
  - Breadcrumb remains hidden when there is only 1 node in path; shows when there are 2+ nodes.
  - `duoxx/app/knowledge-absorb.tsx` was restored to a valid state after JSX/string corruption and passes checks again.
- Verification:
  - `npx tsc --noEmit` (duoxx) -> pass
  - `npm run lint -- app/knowledge-absorb.tsx` (duoxx) -> pass

## 2026-04-14 - Commit guardrails (encoding + temp files)
- Current status:
  - Added staged commit guard script: `duoxx/scripts/guard-staged-files.js`.
  - Added versioned pre-commit hook: `duoxx/.githooks/pre-commit`.
  - Added npm scripts: `guard:staged`, `hooks:install`.
  - Added temp/debug ignore patterns in `duoxx/.gitignore`.
  - Added operator doc: `duoxx/docs/COMMIT_GUARD.md`.
  - Local repo hook path configured in `duoxx`: `.githooks`.
- Verification:
  - `npm run guard:staged` (duoxx) -> pass
  - Guard negative test with staged temp file -> blocked as expected
  - `git config --get core.hooksPath` (duoxx) -> `.githooks`

## 2026-04-14 - Root repo commit guardrails enabled
- Current status:
  - Added root staged guard script: `scripts/guard-staged-files.js`.
  - Added root pre-commit hook: `.githooks/pre-commit`.
  - Added root `.gitignore` temp/debug patterns.
  - Added root guide: `COMMIT_GUARD.md`.
  - Root `core.hooksPath` now points to `.githooks`.
- Verification:
  - `node scripts/guard-staged-files.js` (root) -> pass
  - Force-staged temp file negative test -> blocked as expected
  - `git config --local --get core.hooksPath` (root) -> `.githooks`

## 2026-04-15 - Operator Review Hub tab header redesign
- Current status:
  - Updated `duoxx/components/admin/OperatorWorkbench.tsx` tab switcher into a segmented tab rail.
  - `Import / Knowledge Review / Task Review` now uses stronger active state contrast and a visible active indicator.
  - Added accessibility semantics for tab selection (`accessibilityRole="tab"`, `accessibilityState.selected`).
- Verification:
  - `npm run lint -- components/admin/OperatorWorkbench.tsx` (duoxx) -> pass
  - `npx tsc --noEmit` (duoxx) -> pass

## 2026-04-15 - Operator tab style flattened (remove nested border look)
- Current status:
  - Removed the outer bordered capsule + inner bordered pills from `OperatorWorkbench` tabs.
  - Tabs now render as a flat row with a bottom divider and active underline indicator only.
  - Active state keeps light tint background for affordance but no ring-in-ring border structure.
- Verification:
  - `npm run lint -- components/admin/OperatorWorkbench.tsx` (duoxx) -> pass
  - `npx tsc --noEmit` (duoxx) -> pass

## 2026-04-16 - Lexicon import copy updated to reflect multi-file support
- Current status:
  - Updated `duoxx/src/config/adminLexicalSingleFile.ts` import description:
    - no longer says “single-file only”
    - now explicitly states support for single and multi-file batch upload
    - clarifies mixed `Markdown/CSV/TXT` upload is supported
  - Updated empty state prompt from “解析一个资产文件” to “解析至少一个资产文件”.
- Verification:
  - `npx tsc --noEmit` (duoxx) -> pass

## 2026-04-16 - Pipeline 极简重设计（3 步流 + 一键发布）
- Current status:
  - Frontend import panel now uses one primary action:
    - `发布到学习库` (replaces visible two-step `导入图谱批次 + 发布快照`)
  - Frontend UI no longer exposes batch/snapshot terminology in primary flow copy.
  - Review blocking keeps two gates:
    - 解析阻断（errors/warnings）
    - 审查阻断（pending relation candidates）
  - Added new unified backend endpoint:
    - `POST /api/pipeline/lexicon/release`
    - internal orchestration: import (if needed) -> gate check -> publish.
  - Added service-level `releaseToLearning` response contract:
    - `status`, `blockedReason`, `pendingReviewCount`, `publishedAt`, `currentPublishId`.
  - Publish consistency updated to current-only retention:
    - stage new snapshot -> switch active pointer -> delete old snapshots.
  - Legacy endpoints (`/lexicon/import-batches`, `/lexicon/publish`) remain for compatibility and are no longer required by the updated UI path.
- Verification:
  - `node --check src/routes/pipeline.js` (duoxx_server_link) -> pass
  - `node --check src/services/lexiconGraphService.js` (duoxx_server_link) -> pass
  - `node --check src/routes/lexiconGraphFlow.test.js` (duoxx_server_link) -> pass
  - `node --check src/services/__tests__/lexiconGraphService.integration.test.js` (duoxx_server_link) -> pass
  - `npx tsc --noEmit` (duoxx) -> pass
- Notes:
  - Backend Jest not runnable in this session environment because `cross-env/jest` binaries are unavailable from local `node_modules`.

## 2026-04-16 - Lexicon 导入页去除非必要状态行
- Current status:
  - Removed the top section status row in `duoxx/components/admin/LexicalAssetImportPanel.tsx`:
    - `文件: ... | 类型: ... | 状态: ...`
  - Existing core flow remains:
    - 选择资产文件 -> 发布到学习库
    - 解析阻断与关系候选审查阻断逻辑保持不变
- Verification:
  - `npx tsc --noEmit` (duoxx) -> pass

## 2026-04-16 - Operator Review Hub 移除 Knowledge Review
- Current status:
  - Removed `Knowledge Review` tab and its full panel from `duoxx/components/admin/OperatorWorkbench.tsx`.
  - Workbench tab set simplified to:
    - `Import`
    - `Task Review`
  - Removed knowledge-node queue request from `reload`, reducing unnecessary data loading in this screen.
- Verification:
  - `npx tsc --noEmit` (duoxx) -> pass

## 2026-04-16 - Operator Review Hub 移除 Task Review + Import-only UI
- Current status:
  - Removed `Task Review` tab and full task review section from `duoxx/components/admin/OperatorWorkbench.tsx`.
  - Removed task/candidate review queue loading and related handlers from this screen.
  - Simplified page structure to single-workflow Import workspace:
    - compact header (`Import Workspace` + metrics + refresh)
    - direct rendering of lexical import panel
    - no tab rail and no secondary review lanes.
- Verification:
  - `npx tsc --noEmit` (duoxx) -> pass
  - `npm run lint -- components/admin/OperatorWorkbench.tsx` (duoxx) -> pass

## 2026-04-16 - Pipeline refresh loop and 429 alert storm fixed
- Current status:
  - Fixed repeated refresh loop in `duoxx/components/admin/PipelineDashboard.tsx` by making `loadCourses` stable (`useCallback`) and wiring `OperatorWorkbench` with a stable `onImportPublished` callback.
  - Added in-flight request dedupe for course loading (`courseLoadInFlightRef`) so concurrent refresh triggers reuse the same request.
  - Added rate-limit detection (`HTTP_429` / "too many requests") with 5-second alert throttle to stop modal spam on web.
  - Updated `duoxx/components/admin/OperatorWorkbench.tsx` to support async `onImportPublished` and await it after publish success.
- Verification:
  - `npx tsc --noEmit` (duoxx) -> pass
  - `npm run lint -- components/admin/PipelineDashboard.tsx components/admin/OperatorWorkbench.tsx components/admin/LexicalAssetImportPanel.tsx` (duoxx) -> pass (with 1 pre-existing warning in `LexicalAssetImportPanel.tsx`)

## 2026-04-30 - 提交前同步当前工作区状态
- Current status:
  - `duoxx` admin import area has been simplified to a single import workspace, and course refresh no longer re-enters request loops or spams 429 alerts.
  - `knowledge-DAG/word_knowledge.md` and `knowledge-DAG/sentencePatterns_knowledge.md` now contain expanded structured entries instead of the earlier sparse seed records.
  - Generated backup artifacts under `asserts/project_20260416_190551*` remain untracked and are not included in the commit.
- Verification:
  - `git -C duoxx diff --check` -> pass
  - `git diff --check` -> pass after whitespace cleanup in `knowledge-DAG/word_knowledge.md`
  - `npx tsc --noEmit` (duoxx) -> pass
  - `npm run lint -- components/admin/OperatorWorkbench.tsx components/admin/PipelineDashboard.tsx components/admin/LexicalAssetImportPanel.tsx` (duoxx) -> pass (1 pre-existing warning in `LexicalAssetImportPanel.tsx`)

## 2026-04-30 - 前后端未提交代码巡检
- Current status:
  - Root repo is clean and only ahead of remote by 3 local commits.
  - Frontend repo `duoxx` is clean and only ahead of remote by 2 local commits.
  - Backend entry `duoxx_server_link` has been identified as a symbolic link to the WSL path `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu-22.04\home\rookie\project\duoxx_server`.
  - Backend git status could not be verified in this session because WSL/UNC access to that target timed out.
- Verification:
  - `git status --short --branch` -> clean
  - `git -C duoxx status --short --branch` -> clean
  - backend `wsl` / UNC git probes -> timeout
